# DengueHack

To fight the global burden and continuing spread of dengue, the European Data Innovation Hub is organizing this data4good hackathon. More info can be found on DengueHack.org. 

Half of the global population is currently at risk of contracting the dengue virus. Denguehack.org is a non-profit initiative by the European Data Innovation Hub, and our primary goal is to bring data scientists and other researchers and professionals from different backgrounds together to help fight the global burden of dengue fever.

On Friday, November 25th, we’ll be launching our 36-hour data4good hackathon. The hackathon is quickly approaching, and we’re excited to announce a few things leading up to the event: we’ve picked a jury who will be deciding the distribution of five prizes, there will be several coaches at your disposal to help you over the course of the hackathon, and a quick overview of the data we’ve gathered in preparation for the event.
Janssen Pharmaceuticals, the pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson, will be sponsoring the following five prizes awarded to participants of the hackathon:

- The overall hackathon winner
- The best prediction model based on our standard dataset
- The best new insight/best idea
- The best visualization
- The most valuable contributor, for those who have provided ideas, data, and their expertise leading up to and during the hackathon

The Jury will be composed of six members, and will judge the event on the following equally weighted criteria: Creativity and Innovation, Visualization, Outcome, Presentation, Potential Impact, and Speed of Implementation.
We are particularly excited to announce the great group of coaches we’ll have at your disposal over the course of the hackathon. We’ll have a team of experts on Dengue issues from Janssen, Dr. Mathieu Carette, the Chief Data Scientist at Forespell to coach on data science topics, python, and Graph. Finally, we’ll have Dr. Edward Vanden Berghe, to provide additional coaching on data science, as well as help with R programming.
As for the data, we’re happy to announce that we have gathered both spatial and tabular data, including Dengue cases from Singapore, Puerto Rico, and Malaysia, as well as global climate, weather, demography, and topography data. After registering for the hackathon here, you can view the data we’ve gathered on ExaVault.
The hackathon will take place at the Auberge des 3 Fontaines, and ticket prices include four meals, dinner Friday evening, and breakfast, lunch, and dinner on Saturday, as well as your own bed available in a shared bedroom.
To find out more, there will be another information session on Tuesday, November 15th. Find out more details about this and future events on our Meetup page.

Consider joining our weekly meetups to discuss the gathered data, new ideas, help eachother out and learn about the Aster platform. A full list of activities organised leading up to this hackathon can be found here.
